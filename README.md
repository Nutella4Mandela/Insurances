# Insurances
This is a project I made from when I was working as a medical assistance and checking for any patient's insurances. I wanted to create a compact insurance list that can help with any criteria that is needed to accept them in the office. 
For example: some insurances require a few conditions in order for them to be seen like if they are a pediatric patient, if this a secondary only to a very specific insurance, or if they have out of network benefits!
