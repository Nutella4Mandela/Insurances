# Insurances
This is a project I made from when I was working as a medical assistant and checking for any patient's insurances. I wanted to create a compact insurance list that can help with any criteria that is needed to accept them in the office. 
For example: some insurances require a few set of conditions in order for them to be seen, such as if they are a pediatric patient, if this a secondary only to a very specific insurance, or if they have out of network benefits! I made it easier for schedulers to make appointments and verify if we accept any insurance that the patients have. It was a fun little project of mine and it helped me learn so much about insurances.

<br/>
You have four doctors that you can choose from each with their respected colors: Dr. Kindler is green, Dr.Benson is red, Dr. Wilson is aqua blue, and PA Swan is purple. In the middle section, there are two boxes that if clicked, can show a dropdown list of a variety of insurances. The left one is the primary insurance option, which must be clicked or else it will bring a pop up stating that the patient needs a primary insurance. The right one is the secondary insurance option, which is optional(Keep in mind that if the patient has a secondary insurance, this box must be used for accuracy).
